[GBDK2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/GBDK-2020) game

Description:You are a ghost cat girl in a procedurally generated haunted house. Your mission is to hunt down the scared little mouse girls that are hiding in the dark corners of the place. Use your special abilities and ghostly powers to open locked doors and overcome obstacles in this exciting 2D platformer.

This game is similar to Mario galaxy or VVVVVV, gravity can be rotated, to program it I had to do the movement on each side, that is, 4 times


This repo is a simple backup, I don't use to document all code and changes (branches and hex number that i dont understand) simply `/src` folder in a `main` branch contain subfolders with most recient, last, or important versionðŸ‘€;and `misc` branch contain everything else disaster ðŸ’£

# tools

For grafics use tools like [GBMB and GBTD](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/GBTD_GBMB) , and [GBTK MegamanX](http://www.yvan256.net/projects/gameboy/#gbtk) to convert bmp/png images that made with various other programs ( [PicsArt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&pcampaignid=web_share) , [8bits painted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onetap.bit8painter&pcampaignid=web_share) , and [Pixilart](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixilart.app&pcampaignid=web_share) for Android and MSpaint on Windows XP :v) also i use  AI Tools ( [dalle mini](https://www.craiyon.com/) , [lexicaart](https://lexica.art/) and stable diffusion)
